                  USAID launched the Global Labor Program in 2016 which lasted

                  promoting basic human rights and justice in the workplace and
                  providing decent employment opportunities around the world.
                  Likewise, this promoted gender equality and protected the
                  rights of minority groups, such as migrants and workers from
                  the informal sector, in the workplace.
